py-harvest
================================================

A library for communicating with Harvest's API supporting OAuth2 authentication.

It's inspired by https://github.com/lann/Harvest, but has some distinctions:
  * Supports Python 3x
  * Supports Oauth2
  * Has tests coverage

It doesn't support basic authentication.
